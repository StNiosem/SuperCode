# SuperCode
SuperCode is an IDE built in Swift and SwiftUI as a passion project.

Built for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and visionOS.
With Love from Niosem.

## Installation
   * **Mac** :
        Download the DMG File from the releases page. Open it, then drag and drop SuperCode to your applications
   * **iOS and iPadOS** : ***I, as a young developer, do not have a signing certificate and/or an Apple developper account. Therefore, SuperCode is not available on the App Store. You will need [AltStore](https://altstore.io) / [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) , Not AltStore PAL. (at least, not yet...)***
        * Download the SuperCode .ipa file from the releases page.
        * Open AltStore/SideStore
        * Go to the "My Apps" section
        * Press the + in the top left corner
        * Select the .ipa file you just downloaded
        * Wait until the install finishes. 
   * **visionOS** :
        *DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN AN APPLE VISION PRO. ALL OF THESE STEPS ARE PURELY THEORETICAL AND ARE NOT VERIFIED BY ME. THIS APP HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN THE VISION PRO SIMULATOR*
        
        * Pair your Vision Pro to Xcode
        * Clone the project's git repository
        * Open the project in Xcode 
        * Build it, and send it to Vision Pro
        * Enjoy your coding experience on a virtual keyboard (external keyboards supported).

## Building
